# Recreate the SONAME symlinks that extraction drops.
#
# docker cp copies symlink TARGETS, not the symlinks themselves, so a library
# arrives only under its versioned filename while every ELF that depends on it
# records the soname:
#
#   libtcnative DT_NEEDED:  libssl.so.1.1        <- what SysPart looks for
#   extracted on disk:      libssl.so.1.1.1zh    <- the only thing present
#
# SysPart resolves DT_NEEDED entries by soname against USER_LIBRARY_PATH. When
# the name is absent it cannot load the dependency, produces an empty call
# graph, and still exits 0 -- so the library silently contributes no syscalls.
#
# Existing files and links are never replaced, so this is safe to re-run.
# extract_runtime_and_jar_libs.sh calls it automatically; run it by hand for
# mirrors extracted before that step existed.
#
# Usage:
#   IMG_NAME=tomcat_9.0.120-jdk8-corretto-al2 ./scripts/relink_sonames.sh
#   ./scripts/relink_sonames.sh /path/to/LIBS_dir
